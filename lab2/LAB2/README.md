To build the code, run:
make

To clean the directory, run:

The file typescript is the file generated by the UNIX script command during my testing. It contains my inputs during my testing.

Alternatively, to run my testing script with my sample queries, run:
./testing.sh
(this uses the input1 file provided and runs on the queries in sample-queries.txt)

To use your own input-file and queries, after building the code, run:
./lab2-cs20b018 [startport] [inputfile]

Any non-priviledged port may be used.
